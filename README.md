Bevy-Pong is an implementation of the classic game pong, created using the Bevy game engine. It hasn't really been balanced for gameplay, but has most of the features you might expect from the classic game. My main goal was to get more comfortable with the Bevy Game Enigne, learn about the export pipeline and to take a project from start to finish.
A lot of the features are heavily influenced by the official Bevy examples, especially the breakout game example.
